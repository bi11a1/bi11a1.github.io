Welcome! I am currently working as an Assistant Professor in the department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET), Bangladesh. Recently, I have completed my MS degree from the same university under the supervision of `Prof. Dr. Mohammad Shamsul Arefin`. My thesis topic was to find the next point-of-interest (POI), given the historical movements of a user. I have also worked on various natural language processing tasks like speech recognition, optical character recognition. My research interests include algorithms, machine learning, and recommender systems. I find more interest on fundamental research topics focusing on core algorithms rather than the applied ones.

I am very enthusiastic about competitive programming, and during my academic year i have achieved noteworthy rank in many national and international level programming contests. I still participate in many online contests like `Codeforces` regular rounds, `Facebook` hacker cups, `Google` code jams, etc. I believe that participating in such contests really helped me to improve my in depth logical reasoning and made me confident in writting complex programs.

In my free time, you will find me playing Chess or RTS games. Starcraft II, Rise of Nations, Factorio, League of Legends are some of my favorite games.
