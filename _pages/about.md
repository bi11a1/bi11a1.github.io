Welcome! I am currently working as an Assistant Professor in the department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET), Bangladesh. Recently, I completed my MS degree from the same university under the supervision of `Prof. Dr. Mohammad Shamsul Arefin`. My thesis topic was to find the next point-of-interest (POI), given the historical movements of a user. To solve the task, attention network was used that incorporates various contextual information like weather conditions and spatiotemporal information into a unified model. In the past, I have also worked on various natural language processing tasks like speech analysis and optical character recognition. I find a keen interest in fundamental research topics focusing on core algorithms. My research interests include Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

I am very enthusiastic about competitive programming, and during my academic years, I have achieved noteworthy ranks in many national and international level programming contests. I still participate in many online contests like `Codeforces` regular rounds, `Facebook` hacker cups, `Google` code jams, etc. I believe that participating in such contests helped me to improve my in-depth logical reasoning and made me confident in writing complex programs.

In my free time, you will find me playing Chess or RTS games. Starcraft II, Rise of Nations, Factorio, and League of Legends are some of my favorite games.
